# 2c. Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## Program

```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
f=lambda a,b:a+b
print(f(a,b))
```

## Result

Thus,to write a Python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum is executed successfully.
